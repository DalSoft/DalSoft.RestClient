## Supported Platforms

RestClient targets .NET Standard 2.0 therefore **supports Windows, Linux, Mac and Xamarin (iOS, Android and UWP)**.

If you need to target .NET Standard 1.4 use version 3.2.2.

## Getting Started

## Install via .NET CLI

```bash
> dotnet add package DalSoft.RestClient
```

## Install via NuGet

```bash
PM> Install-Package DalSoft.RestClient
```

## Example calling a REST API 

You start by new'ing up the RestClient and passing in the base uri for your RESTful API. 

For example if your wanted to perform a GET on [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1) you would do the following:

**Static Typed Rest Client**

For the Static typed Rest Client just pass a string representing the resource you want access to the Resource method, and then call the HTTP method you want to use. 
```cs
var client = new RestClient("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com");

User user = await client.Resource("users/1").Get();
   
Console.WriteLine(user.Name);
```

**Dynamicaly Typed Rest Client**

For the Dynamicaly typed Rest Client chain members that would make up the resource you want to access - ending with the HTTP method you want to use. 
```cs
dynamic client = new RestClient("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com");

var user = await client.Users(1).Get();
   
Console.WriteLine(user.name);
```
> Note all HTTP methods are async

## About
RestClient is a very lightweight wrapper around System.Net.HttpClient that uses the dynamic features of .NET 4 to provide a fluent way of accessing RESTFul API's, making it trivial to create REST requests using a lot less code. 

Originally created to remove the boilerplate code involved in making REST requests using code that is testable. I know there are a couple of  REST clients out there but I wanted the syntax to look a particular way with minimal fuss.

RestClient is biased towards posting and returning JSON - if you don't provide Accept and Content-Type headers then they are set to application/json by default [See Working with non JSON content](https://restclient.dalsoft.io/docs/content-other-than-json/).
